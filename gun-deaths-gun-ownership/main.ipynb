    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While our data looks different than the original, there does still seem to be a positive correlation between gun ownership rates and gun fatality rates. This does not necessarily prove causation, and many on the right argue that we should only count gun murders, not all gun fatalities. However, the data presented in the video in question was likely sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between party affiliation is interesting as well, with Republican states clearly among the top in both gun ownership and fatality. The opposite extreme is held exclusively by Democratic-leaning states, while many from both parties lie towards the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this was an interesting and fun project and I think the insights are valuable. My choice to neglect individual state labels came down to a matter of time, but if anyone wants to clone this notebook and label them, I would happily pull it into [the GitHub repository where this project is kept](https://github.com/MitchellHarrison/data-viz-for-social-media).\n",
